    <h2> Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
        You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Heat the pan:</span>Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Cook the omelette:</span>Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
        the eggs evenly coat the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Add fillings (optional):</span>When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
        middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Fold and serve:</span>As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
        fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Enjoy:</span>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
      </li>
